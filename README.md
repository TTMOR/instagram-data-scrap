# instagram data scrap

- use "Pip Install instaloader" . If you want to install it Globally use " !Pip"

- read GraphQL Params that i compile below. So, you can filter the Json file on your way( trasnlate to your language)
- Some bugs are expected. Instagram does not show the entire list of likes, but we can view it using Instagram's server (I will not teach this here).
-  Private profiles are more complex to extract, but we can do it the same way. I will not teach these tactics here.
-  Modify the code of the "Instaloader" package to meet your needs.
-  Use a virtual environment to run! Anaconda is often incompatible with many AI packages, so use Pip or Uv.

- I did all on portuguese PT-BR. Translate it to you langauge.
